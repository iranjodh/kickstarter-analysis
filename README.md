In month of Feb ,May, June almost half of the shows in ratio to  successful shows were failed which was quite alarming.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The most successful range of goal expectation was between $1000 to $4999 with 73% sucecess rate which was total of 388 shows. On the contray,the shows wioth goal $1000 to $4999 with 146 failed shows. There was one show with goal of 45000 to 49999 and it was failed. One of the outcome of the for the "plays" category was that there was no show cancelled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Summer months like May and June reltively more successful compared to other months and Decemeber being the least successful. It could be because people prefer other activities in the winter compared to going to shows.
2) 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the biggest limitation of this dataset that there is no information as to why the shows were failed and cancelled. If we were to make the correct deciions for the future this type of data can be very relevent.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  We didn't do any anlyses for spaces sub category which could also provide us with more relevent informatoion about the data set. We could also a do a concise pie chart comparing the %age of successful failed and cancelled in adddition to Bar and line charts.
